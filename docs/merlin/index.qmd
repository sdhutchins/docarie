These pages provide a guided tour through the main features and quirks of MERLIN. The section on [input file formats](input_files.qmd) is recommended for all users. The other sections will depend on the focus of your research.

This has been adapted from the [merlin tutorial website](https://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/Merlin/tour/).

## Getting Started

I recommend starting with the [Input Files](input_files.qmd) section to understand the data formats used by MERLIN, then moving to the specific analysis type that matches your research goals.

## Available Tutorials

Merlin can be used for:

- **[Parametric Linkage Analysis](parametric.qmd)** - Traditional parametric linkage analysis
- **[Non-parametric Linkage Analysis](linkage.qmd)** - Model-free linkage analysis methods
- **[Regression-based Linkage Analysis](regress.qmd)** - Regression approaches for linkage
- **[Association Analysis](assoc.qmd)** - SNP association testing for quantitative traits
- **[IBD and Kinship Estimation](ibd.qmd)** - Identity by descent and kinship calculations
- **[Haplotyping](haplotyping.qmd)** - Haplotype reconstruction and analysis
- **[Error Detection](error.qmd)** - Identifying and handling genotyping errors
- **[Simulation](simulation.qmd)** - Generating simulated genetic data
- **[Linkage Disequilibrium](disequilibrium.qmd)** - Accommodating LD between markers
- **[WGS Preprocessing and Genetic Maps](notes.qmd)** - Comprehensive guide for WGS data preparation and genetic map integration
